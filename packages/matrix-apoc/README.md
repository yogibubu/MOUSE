# APOC

**APOC — Atomic and Pairwise Observables from the Charge density** is the
MATRIX tool that normalizes the electronic part of QM results.

APOC owns two related backend-independent contracts:

- a population contract with Hirshfeld and CM5 atomic charges, the complete
  Mayer bond-order matrix, electron count, molecular charge, and provenance;
- an electronic-state contract containing the AO metric, orbitals,
  occupations, density matrices, optional Fock matrices, and transition
  densities.

APOC also owns the accepted-state history used between geometry evaluations.
Resident and process-based calculators export their converged state to APOC;
APOC validates compatibility and prepares projected or extrapolated guesses.
LINK consumes those guesses without maintaining a second matrix lifecycle.

The canonical data are written to `#QM_POPULATION` using schema
`matrix.qm.population.v1`.  Gaussian/GDV output is parsed directly.  Other
programs can currently export a complete Molden file (basis plus occupied
molecular orbitals), from which APOC reconstructs the AO density and evaluates
the same Hirshfeld/CM5 and Mayer definitions through PySCF. Molden is an import
adapter, not the native persistence contract. Complete electronic states are
stored in TREXIO (HDF5 by default). PySCF and Psi4 wavefunctions can be captured
directly through their Python APIs, without writing Molden; the same direct
adapter pattern is the contract for the remaining electronic-structure
backends.

ECP wavefunctions use an explicit valence-space population contract.  Neutral
Hirshfeld pro-atoms are calculated with the same orbital basis and ECP,
`q_A = Z_eff,A - N_val,A`, while CM5 receives the physical atomic number
`Z_A = Z_eff,A + N_core,A`.  Per-atom frozen-core electron counts are
serialized and the reported total electron count includes them.  Mayer bond
orders remain defined in the explicit valence AO space.  No artificial core
density is added.

For a Gaussian formatted checkpoint, the direct adapter imports the AO basis,
orbitals, occupations and available density matrices into APOC's
backend-neutral electronic-state contract. No Molden file is created or read.
APOC then evaluates its common Hirshfeld/CM5 and Mayer definitions. The
Gaussian log adapter remains available as an independent check when
`Pop=Hirshfeld IOp(6/80=1)` was requested.

State tracking uses a one-to-one maximum-overlap assignment. It reports the
selected overlap, phase, runner-up overlap and assignment margin. Energy order
is diagnostic only: it never defines electronic-state identity.

For TD scans and optimizations, `follow_excited_state` exposes the same rule as
a programmatic step guard. A failed minimum-overlap or ambiguity test raises
`StateContinuityError` in strict mode, allowing the driver to reject the step,
reduce its size or request additional roots. This makes root following
independent of backend-specific root numbering.

`natural_orbitals(D, S)` accepts any correlated one-particle density, not only
a mean-field density. `recanonicalize_orbitals(C, F, S)` diagonalizes the Fock
operator only inside equal-occupation subspaces by default; consequently the
natural-orbital density is unchanged and the resulting orbitals can be handed
to another code through TREXIO.

ORACLE's L0 population acquisition normally uses PBE0/def2-TZVP and the native
def2 ECP where required.  The future L1 acquisition is MP2 with a cardinal
basis family still to be fixed.  Both levels preserve the complete APOC
electronic state, one-particle density, natural orbitals and natural
occupations.  Both natural-orbital spaces can seed PNO work.  L0 still needs a
subsequent pair-correlation construction, while L1 additionally retains the
MP2 T2 amplitudes and pair densities and is therefore directly PNO-ready.
The correlated MP2 rung is also the preferred one for cardinal-basis
extrapolations and related convergence models.  MP2 avoids DFT quadrature,
but Hirshfeld integration itself remains numerical at both levels.

ORACLE may consume APOC data in place of its geometry-only estimates.
ARCHITECT/ZAFF requires the APOC CM5/Mayer contract by default. Alternative
charge or bond-order definitions must be supplied and labelled explicitly;
they never silently replace CM5 or Mayer.
